- The code is very clear and doesnt repeat itself, Great job!
- Loved the idea, i feel like it really has a good functionality and use 
for people who buy crypto.
- It is also great that the user can choose from basically all of the 
coins instead of just havong a fixed one.
- the run forever is also very functional as the user doesnt have to run 
the code all the time and the grpah changes automatically.
- overall very good project, amazing job!
